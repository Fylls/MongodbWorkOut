need more servers.

The issue here of course is this might sound logical but the servers

now don't duplicate the data,

they are not backups,

they split the data. So server A, the one on the left let's say stores data for the same application

as the other servers but a different chunk of it

and that is really important to understand. With sharding, you have multiple computers who all run mongodb

servers but these serverss don't work standalone but work together and split up the available

data, so the data is distributed across your shards, not replicated.
